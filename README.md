Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
========================================

####The task of the project is to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

For the purpose of the task the script will download the ZIP archive which includes all necessary data for analysis (from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

As the result tidy data that can be used for later analysis will be prepared.

####Dependencies

run_analysis.R file helps to install the dependency automatically (data.table R package).
